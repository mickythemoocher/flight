<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> We regret to say that the 11am flight to Hamburg is delayed by twenty minutes. This is due to circumstances beyond our control. We thank you for your patience<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh no dear that's our flight!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker</font color="#0000FF"> ( she is a little deaf) Yes, these airports are always too bright, hurts my eyes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">I didn't say anything about too bright I said that's our flight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">What's our flight? I thought we were going to Hamburg<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">We are going to Hamburg but it has been delayed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">How do you know that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">It was announced on the Tannoy, didn't you hear it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">No. sorry, I was thinking of something<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Surely you can hear an announcement even if you are thinking of something<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">I can't hear an announcement<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Of course you can't, she is not saying it now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Oh I see<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Have you got your hearing aid switched on?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> What?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">5Mrs: Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Oh never mind, lets get our Luggage checked in<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF">We regret to inform you that the  11am flight to Hamburg will now be boarding at 12 mid day. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Did you hear that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I did – We hope everyone flying to Hamburg will have a pleasant stay<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble</font color="#0000FF"> (lets out a big sigh) Please turn on your hearing aid dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Let me see – its 8.45<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">I give up. Let's get checked in<p>
 ( a short pause)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> Good afternoon ladies, lets check those cases in for you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> The 11am flight to Hamburg will now be boarding at 12.36  -   Probably. Ok I know what you are thinking but it's not my fault. I am just the messenger. And I am also working through my coffee break so you are not the only ones delayed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh my goodness it is getting later and later<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it is very unfortunate and annoying<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> It's because of the fog<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">No we don't have a dog, just these cases<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Excuse my sister please, she is a little hard of hearing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Let's pop the first case on the scales then<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh dear that is very heavy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> I know I had to carry it from the taxi rank<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">What Vicky means is that it is overweight. I am afraid there will be a surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> A SURCHARGE???<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">(Almost to herself) Hmm she heard that alright<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Yes if the baggage is overweight we have to make a surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">How much?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">Twenty three pounds<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">TWENTY THREE POUNDS???<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">I assume you have turned on your hearing aid dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">This is outrageous<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">I do apologise but it is the airline's rules<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Well we are not going to pay it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">It does seem a lot of extra to pay for being a little over weight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">We just have to charge it I'm afraid<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer: </font color="#0000FF">Ok you're not going to like this but the 11am flight to Hamburg is not going to board till 14.00 hours. And I would like to point out I still haven't had my coffee break, and it doesn't look like I am going to get it any time soon. Just so you know I have a delay to deal with too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs:</font color="#0000FF"> We demand to see the manager<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker </font color="#0000FF">Yes we do, we are not going to pay this surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">He will only tell you the same thing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Please call him right now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, you can all stop worrying about me now, my coffee has arrived. It's a good job I have more patience than the passengers. All they seem to do is moan<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">I hope it chokes him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Beatrice! There is no need for that kind of talk<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss: Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> Hmmfff<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">(On phone call) Hello, Pat? Can you come to the desk please, we have a problem ( a short pause) Ok, thank you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF">Are they coming?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Yes on the way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> Guess what? The Hamburg plane is now going to be boarding at 14.30. Apparently it is because of the fog. I just looked out of the window and I can't see anything<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> How can she see there is no fog if it is foggy?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Never mind dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Good morning ladies, how can I help you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">This clerk will not accept our luggage<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">No, no, that is not true, of course we will accept the luggage but there has to be a surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Is the case overweight?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, so there should be a surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Cindy is correct I am afraid. If your luggage is overweight there has to be a surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Why?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">It is the company rules I am afraid<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> And why is it a company rule<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Because the plane is only allowed to carry a certain weight. If it is over that it could be dangerous to fly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> But if we pay twenty three pounds then does that somehow reduce the weight of the luggage because If I pass you a twenty pound note we will only be reducing the weight by what the note weighs<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">Sorry we do not take cash, only debit cards<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: </font color="#0000FF">Thimble: Makes even less sense then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">But charging extra for overweight baggage  does discourages people from over packing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> I'm glad I am not going to Hamburg, having said that, you may not be either. It is 15.00 hours now. I'd head to bar if I were you. Exactly where I am going when I finish my shift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I have an idea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">If it saves us twenty pounds let's hear it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Pat will always help if he possible<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, May I suggest that you take a few things from this case to get it to the correct weight and place them in your hand luggage<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Which will be travelling on the same plane<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Errr, yes but it will save you twenty pounds<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">And the weight in the plane will be exactly the same I believe?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Well yes, it will be<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">I may be deaf but I'm not daft. That makes absolutely no sense to me at all<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Makes no sense to me either<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">It does save you twenty three pounds though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> And we can help you do it if you like<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">We don't need any help to do it because we are not going to do it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Please ladies, we have a long queue forming here<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Which is not our fault<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">But it is your fault. You will not pay the surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> No we won't, because it is ridiculous<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> Then you must move aside then because other passengers are waiting to check in<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">We are moving nowhere till this is sorted out.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> It is sorted out, either you pay the surcharge or you don't fly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble</font color="#0000FF">: Are you threatening me?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">No madam I am not threatening you but we have to serve the other people in the queue<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Put our luggage through then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> We cannot do that unless you make the extra payment<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> Which we are not going to do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok this is a hopeless situation here. There must be an answer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> One two, testing. One two testing. Dear ladies and gentlemen, you are not going to like this. You are not going to like it one bit. And please believe me when I say it gives no pleasure at all to to say this ( a short laugh)– What was the 11am flight to Hamburg. Do you remember that?  Has now been cancelled. There will be no further flights to Hamburg until Thursday. It's raining there today anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">But it is only Tuesday. We can't stand arguing at this desk for two days<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> It seems we have reached a solution after all. As your flight has been cancelled there is little point in checking in your luggage<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">What are we to do then? We need to get to Hamburg to meet up with our other sister<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> (quietly) Three of them! What a nightmare<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">This is terrible, terrible<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I may be able to help. There is a flight later to Berlin. If we can get you on that, we can then transfer you to Hamburg<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Berlin????<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, Berlin<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">What about the wall<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Wall? What wall?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">The Berlin wall. Won't we get stuck behind it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> The Berlin wall was knocked down in 1989<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Nobody told me that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">They probably did but you just didn't hear them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs. Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">And how do we get from Berlin to Hamburg?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> I am sure we can arrange a connecting flight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">It will be a very quick journey, less than an hour<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">I suppose it is an option<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">A perfect solution I would say<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Better than waiting two days<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss: Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Which desk do we need to go to to get the flight to Berlin<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> Desk 14<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, Desk 14 - Luton airport<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> LUTON AIRPORT???<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> But this is Gatwick<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes it is, we need to get you to Luton<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">No. We are not going to travel on to Luton<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I am trying to help you ladies<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">It doesn't seem like much help to me. First you won't accept our luggage now you want to send us off to Luton<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">Of course we would have accepted your luggage<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">We would have been happy to do that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">And I would have been happy to change the flight for you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Only by sending us to Luton<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I am doing my best to help<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer: </font color="#0000FF">Hey! Guess what? The fog is lifting we may get flights again. Stay with me folks for more news. Got my fingers crossed for you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">That is good news maybe you will be able to fly from here after all<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Is that with or without our luggage<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">With it of course<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Providing you pay the surcharge of course<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">Which we, of course, refuse to do<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I have offered suggestions but you don't seem to want to take them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Because they are stupid suggestions<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> I think Pat has tried to be very helpful<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> Always helpful.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok. Are you ready for this folks? The 11am flight to Hamburg is back on. It will be leaving from gate number 14 at 15.00 hours, so I hope you didn't spend too long in the bar. We thank you for your patience, if there was any<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">There you are. Your flight is going ahead<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Just pay the 23 pounds and you will be on your way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">We are not paying<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">You will probably lose it anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">We never lose luggage<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> When I flew to Norway last year my luggage went to Los Angeles<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF">We don't lose it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">No, we just send it on a little adventure<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">If that's the case it didn't even send me a postcard<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I really cannot spend any more time trying to sort this out <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> You have been very patient Pat<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> the queue is getting longer, people are getting very irritated<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> That's not our fault<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">No it isn't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer: </font color="#0000FF">I agree with them, it is your fault<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> WHAT?  Can he hear us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> No he can't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">There are cameras though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> He lip reads<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> He ought to mind her own business<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">I have a solution. We have to clear this queue now the flights are back on<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">You are going to let them through?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky:</font color="#0000FF"> Without paying the surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">No, I will pay the surcharge, here take my debit card<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Oh no you don't!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> What's the problem now?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> Do we look like we have no money?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">No you don't but I am trying to help, and I must clear this queue<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer: </font color="#0000FF">These two are unbelievable. I think we are going to see them on YouTube<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">First you refuse our luggage, then you try to pack us off to Luton and now you are trying to treat us like a charity case<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat:</font color="#0000FF"> I am doing nothing of the kind<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF"> Just trying to pay your surcharge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">Because you won't do it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF">  I have never been so insulted in all my life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker: </font color="#0000FF">And nor have I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Announcer:</font color="#0000FF"> I have. People are always insulting me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Nobody is trying to insult you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">We are just trying to resolve a difficult situation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy: </font color="#0000FF">And it seems resolving it is even more difficult than the situation was in the first place<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">Well, there is nothing more that I can suggest. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs: Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> I will never fly this airline again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> And nor will I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">We have tried our best<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Well it wasn't good enough<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Cindy:</font color="#0000FF"> I can't think what else we could have done<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Vicky: </font color="#0000FF">We gave you several options<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble: </font color="#0000FF">Well, we have one option left<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pat: </font color="#0000FF">And what is that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mrs Thimble:</font color="#0000FF"> Come on Beatrice, grab your case, we are going <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Beaker:</font color="#0000FF"> Going where?<p>
